Originally based on [DBM for Warmane - Icecrown](https://github.com/Ayaro1/DBM_Warmane_Icecrown). Most edits done by Sariyo, Gjeneth, Arrj, Nimloth, Zbruennig and anyone else mentioned in the changelog below.

A version of WotLK DBM with accurate timers for Warmane servers. Please see the Release tab to find the latest stable version.


# Changelog 
#### General Notes
* This is a continuation of [DBM for Warmane - Icecrown](https://github.com/Ayaro1/DBM_Warmane_Icecrown)
* Timings are based on personal experience, vods, and logs of other guilds on Frostmourne. 
* Due to some form of spell batching / spell queuing, there is a small amount of randomness on a lot of boss abilities. 
* * Most of these are marked as CDs
* For example: Frost Blast on Kel'Thuzad, Locust Swarm (Cast, not the duration) on Anub'Rekhan, Noth's first Blink, and Eonar's Gift are the most random.
